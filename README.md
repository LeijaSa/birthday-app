# Birthday App

### Assignment

Develop a Python application that takes names and birthdays as input and provides the names of the **oldest** and **youngest** people as output.

### Requirements

- The application must handle input for more than two people.
- It should work regardless of the order in which the input data is provided (i.e., the program must perform the sorting itself).
